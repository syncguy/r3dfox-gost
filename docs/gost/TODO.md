# r3dfox GOST TLS — TODO / Deferred Work

This file is the persistent forward-looking backlog. Current synthesis is in `PROJECT_STATE.md`; exact runtime test sequencing/recovery is in `STAGE2_RUNTIME_TEST_PLAN.md`; the GIS GMP multi-host mTLS branch is in `STAGE2_GIS_GMP.md`; experiment evidence is in `TEST_LOG.md` and dated volumes.

## GOST TLS runtime — immediate

F1 close/shutdown lifecycle, F2 positive `Once` fanout/scope, F3 generic GOST mTLS host scope, GIS-G4 cross-host decision isolation, explicit positive `Session` lifetime, the SD1-SD6 Session-default exact-artifact regression, T3 explicit Cancel/no-certificate semantics, T4 involuntary tab/load Abort semantics, T7/T8 missing-medium/provider recovery, the T9 long-provider-wait characterization, and T10 detailed Russian picker presentation are closed as experiments.

Current Session-default runtime evidence is source `afbdad307f63e594d3715169d6e34235280dddaf`, main run `33073577269`, job `98521835354`, artifact `9652941006`. Do not repeat closed tests on unchanged source merely for confirmation.

### 1. Continue client-decision / provider semantics

Immediate next:

1. **T6 — real Permanent semantics.** Implement and prove persistence distinct from the current process-local non-Once store, including intended process-restart persistence and the intended forget/change behavior.
2. **T11/T12 — discovery boundary.** Verify dynamic `CurrentUser\MY` re-enumeration and determine whether provider/removable-media-only identities are discoverable without browser restart or interactive provider/PIN/media UI during candidate enumeration.

**T5 — Session failure-boundary regression is DEFERRED, not closed.** The 2026-08-28 T5 probe showed that removing the key medium *after* a successful Treasury Session mTLS does not create a provider failure: CryptoPro/SSPI retains an already-acquired credential context, and a fresh Treasury socket about 192 seconds later still receives a new CertificateRequest, reuses `scope=session`, emits a client-auth flight and completes TLS 1.2 / `0xFF85` mTLS. Therefore post-login medium removal is not a valid T5 fault injection in the current environment. Resume T5 only when there is a safe deterministic way to invalidate an already-acquired provider/private-key credential inside the same browser process; do not invent an invasive synthetic invalidation merely to force the test.

T7/T8 prove the complementary pre-acquisition boundary on the current artifact: with the certificate still discoverable from `CurrentUser\MY` but the key medium unavailable before first private-key acquisition, provider refusal produces `SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS` only for that MSSPI attempt; the positive Firefox `Session` decision survives, and after the medium returns the next request in the same browser process reuses `scope=session`, completes GOST mTLS and resumes protected application traffic without another picker.

T9 now proves the long-wait concurrency boundary. A positive Treasury Session selection entered the synchronous CryptoPro/SSPI provider path for `74.742 s`. The Firefox UI remained responsive by user observation, but the shared Firefox Socket Thread produced no `GostTLS` activity during that interval. When the provider action was cancelled, `SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS` returned and queued network work resumed immediately: `pay.gov.ru` began on the same timestamp and completed GOST TLS `291 ms` later. The later Treasury flow still reused `scope=session` and recovered successfully. Thus timeout/coordinator state remains safe, but **global Socket Thread network starvation during synchronous provider UI is a confirmed behavior**.

T10 closes the detailed picker presentation on the current artifact: human-readable owner/issuer presentation, correct Cyrillic and localized expiry, readable details, serial details-only, all three remember choices visible, and `Session` visibly selected by default. The successful post-inspection Treasury login is only a functional smoke; T10 does not imply real `Permanent` persistence.

T3/T4 establish the negative-decision split on the current artifact: explicit picker Cancel is consumed as Declined/phase `2`, while an unanswered picker abandoned by tab/load teardown remains unresolved phase `0` and is removed by lifecycle cleanup. Neither path poisons later recovery.

The current source routes every non-`Once` positive choice through the same in-memory remember store. Therefore real persistent `Permanent` semantics remain unproven; do not assume the current `Permanent` UI choice survives process restart.

### 2. Provider-wait Socket Thread isolation follow-up

T9 failed the intended no-network-starvation subcriterion: while CryptoPro/provider key access was synchronously blocked for `74.742 s`, new network work from other browser windows/tabs queued behind the same Firefox Socket Thread and started only when the provider call returned.

Open follow-up:

- compare this behavior with stock Firefox synchronous client-certificate/token/PIN handling before declaring it an incompatibility;
- determine whether MSSPI/CryptoPro key-access can be moved off the shared Socket Thread without breaking NSPR/MSSPI state ownership, client-auth lifecycle, cancellation, or proxy/CONNECT sequencing;
- do not redesign threading merely from intuition: preserve the exact T9 capture as the concrete baseline and require a focused implementation experiment if offloading is attempted;
- treat this as a responsiveness/performance limitation, not as evidence of a failed GOST handshake or broken UI event loop.

### 3. Continue the remaining Stage 2 runtime matrix

Remaining groups include:

- T5 deterministic failure-boundary test once an already-acquired provider credential can be invalidated safely;
- dynamic `CurrentUser\MY` discovery and token-only/removable-media discovery;
- no acceptable cert / unsuitable cert / wrong cert / unavailable key / PIN-private-key failure / server rejection;
- issuer-aware validity/KU/EKU/private-key candidate policy;
- sensitive-log audit;
- final exact-build Treasury mTLS regression.

### 4. Attribute picker timeout and residual poll churn

T2R and the T3 timeout segment both show lifecycle-safe but non-fixed picker teardown timing. T2R measured `32.576 s`, `37.420 s`, `30.330 s`; T3 measured one additional unanswered-picker removal after `30.276 s`. T4 is deliberately different: closing the owning tab removed the pending decision after only `4.059 s`, confirming that its teardown was user/load driven rather than timeout driven.

T9 is also distinct from those Firefox-picker timeouts: after the Firefox certificate decision had already resolved, the Socket Thread remained synchronously inside provider/key acquisition for `74.742 s` until provider Cancel. No automatic ~30-second picker teardown occurred in that state.

Before changing timeout policy or calling the wait path fully quiescent:

- identify which Firefox/Necko/load timer actually tears down each timed-out *Firefox picker* attempt;
- keep that lifecycle separate from the T9 provider/key-access wait;
- explain why the first historical picker-timeout cycle polls much more aggressively than later cycles;
- preserve stock-compatible timeout semantics rather than introducing an arbitrary GOST-specific timeout.

## GOST TLS security — mandatory Stage 2 server-trust closure

Complete fail-closed server verification:

- reject `verifyOk == 0`;
- reject any nonzero verification status;
- integrate Firefox temporary/permanent certificate overrides;
- positive browser-session verification cache keyed by exact server identity;
- prove valid Treasury hostname/chain succeeds;
- prove wrong hostname and invalid/untrusted chain fail;
- prove client private-key operations cannot occur before server trust.

Do not use a production verification bypass.

## GOST network coverage — later

After Stage 2 security/runtime closure:

- direct connection without proxy;
- HTTPS proxy / nested TLS;
- SOCKS lifecycle;
- proxy authentication/reconnect edge cases beyond the currently exercised HTTP CONNECT path.

## Final UX polish — later

After core GOST TLS is stable, evaluate transparent one-shot GOST discovery:

- explicit allowlist still enters MSSPI immediately;
- unknown host starts with NSS;
- only `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` may authorize one MSSPI retry;
- no retry loops;
- only a successful, normally verified GOST connection becomes session-confirmed;
- discovery cache is process/session scoped and never bypasses trust/client-auth policy.

## Windows compatibility — independent

The representative Windows XP SP3 x86 coexistence question is closed for source `d78137a931145af877dc458b01e494ad0467723d`, run `33138244191`, job `98743029100`, runtime artifact `9673057839`: the exact probe with bundled msvcr14x `ucrtbase.dll` and `msvcp140.dll` ran three times on physical Windows XP SP3 x86 with `ExitCode=0`.

The first full Firefox 153 x86 integration build now also exists: source `982d6529a707c6feecad97c725feed8a3cd21c81`, run `33141004769`, job `98751650853`, package artifact `9676548553`, physical-test runtime artifact `9676549576`, diagnostics artifact `9676550507`. Full compilation/package/runtime staging succeeded; the run is red only because the post-build XP import audit failed. Physical tests have converted that broad audit result into concrete runtime blockers.

Open work, in order:

1. **XP x32 loader blocker — `CloseThreadpoolWork`.** On physical XP the browser does not reach UI startup because a startup-loaded PE module has a hard `KERNEL32!CloseThreadpoolWork` dependency. Identify the exact importing module from the build diagnostics/import tables; redirect/remove only that observed hard import using the narrow compatibility strategy; rebuild and rerun the exact physical XP startup test. Do not assume the dialog title proves `r3dfox.exe` itself owns the import.
2. **Win7 x32 content-sandbox RNG blocker — candidate fix awaiting exact runtime validation.** Physical Win7 evidence localizes the immediate tab death to `RandomUint64OrDie` after the sandboxed `RtlGenRandom` / `SystemFunction036` path fails; the same binary browses real pages when the content sandbox is disabled, so the failure is sandbox-dependent. Commit `27bf83a679ec26b93bc72a0ec7635fb26f821782` now pre-warms the exact Mozilla OS RNG path on pre-Win8 systems in `LowerContentSandbox()` before `LowerToken()`, matching Chromium's renderer warm-up ordering while keeping the sandbox enabled. Next: build the exact full x86 browser from this source, run it on physical Win7 with the content sandbox **enabled**, and require ordinary tabs/pages to survive startup. Do not call this fixed until that exact runtime passes.
3. **Win7 later crash — separate blocker.** With the content sandbox disabled the browser later crashes after some successful browsing. Capture and diagnose that later failure separately; do not conflate it with the now-localized `RandomUint64OrDie` startup crash. Prefer debugger/minidump evidence once the sandbox/RNG blocker is fixed or bypassed diagnostically.
4. Re-run the resulting exact full x86 build on physical Win7 and XP after each compatibility fix, treating each newly observed loader/runtime failure as a separate evidence-backed blocker rather than preemptively rewriting every audit finding.
5. Keep GOST TLS-on-old-Windows as a later exact-build/runtime milestone independent from loader/startup compatibility. A browser that starts and browses ordinary pages still does not prove the MSSPI GOST path on XP/Win7.

## Bundled government-system extensions — independent

Current packaged three-extension artifact `9614275050` is packaging-proven and clean-profile discovery/enabled-state is proven for all three project extensions.

Next:

1. re-check CryptoPro basic functionality on this exact package;
2. test legacy IFCPlugin with installed native host;
3. test Gosplugin with its local/native component;
4. verify the Russian-first content-language preference in runtime if desired;
5. generalize the historically CryptoPro-named packaging workflow to assert all three XPI + language pref;
6. transfer only proven shared packaging gates into the two main browser workflows;
7. later prove real version-to-version update behavior where a valid older/newer signed extension is available.

## Upstream base — deferred

Stay on r3dfox / Firefox 153. Do not migrate to Firefox 154 merely because upstream Mozilla has released it. Evaluate a newer base only after r3dfox itself publishes one and the user explicitly decides to upgrade.
