# r3dfox GOST TLS — TODO / Deferred Work

This file is the persistent forward-looking backlog. Current synthesis is in `PROJECT_STATE.md`; exact runtime test sequencing/recovery is in `STAGE2_RUNTIME_TEST_PLAN.md`; the GIS GMP multi-host mTLS branch is in `STAGE2_GIS_GMP.md`; experiment evidence is in `TEST_LOG.md` and dated volumes.

## GOST TLS runtime — immediate

F1 close/shutdown lifecycle, F2 positive `Once` fanout/scope, F3 generic GOST mTLS host scope, GIS-G4 cross-host decision isolation, explicit positive `Session` lifetime, and the SD1-SD6 Session-default exact-artifact regression are closed.

Current Session-default runtime evidence is source `afbdad307f63e594d3715169d6e34235280dddaf`, main run `33073577269`, job `98521835354`, artifact `9652941006`. Do not repeat SD1-SD6 on unchanged source merely for confirmation.

### 1. Continue client-decision semantics

Immediate next tests:

1. **T3 — explicit Cancel / no certificate.** A deliberate user decline must remain attempt-local and must not create sticky negative state; a later independent attempt must receive a fresh picker.
2. **T4 — involuntary Abort.** Navigation/tab/load teardown without a user decision must be classified as `Aborted`, not reusable `Declined`; a later attempt must recover normally.
3. **T5 — Session failure-boundary regression.** The positive Session lifetime is already proven; additionally verify temporary provider failures and matching-policy boundaries cannot overwrite or leak the positive Session decision.
4. **T6 — real Permanent semantics.** Implement and prove persistence distinct from the current process-local non-Once store, including the intended forget/change behavior.

The current source routes every non-`Once` positive choice through the same in-memory remember store. Therefore real persistent `Permanent` semantics remain unproven; do not assume the current `Permanent` UI choice survives process restart.

### 2. Continue the remaining Stage 2 runtime matrix

Remaining groups include:

- missing-media/provider Cancel and recovery;
- long provider-media wait using measured current-artifact timeout behavior;
- Russian picker row/details rendering beyond the completed SD6 smoke;
- dynamic `CurrentUser\MY` discovery and token-only/removable-media discovery;
- no acceptable cert / unsuitable cert / wrong cert / unavailable key / PIN-private-key failure / server rejection;
- issuer-aware validity/KU/EKU/private-key candidate policy;
- sensitive-log audit;
- final exact-build Treasury mTLS regression.

### 3. Attribute picker timeout and residual poll churn

T2R proved lifecycle safety but also showed non-uniform timeout/poll behavior:

- picker-to-close intervals: `32.576 s`, `37.420 s`, `30.330 s`;
- `GostPoll client-auth wait quiescent`: `10,825`, `34`, and `21` calls respectively.

Before changing timeout policy or calling the wait path fully quiescent:

- identify which Firefox/Necko/load timer actually tears down each attempt;
- explain why the first cycle polls much more aggressively than later cycles;
- preserve stock-compatible timeout semantics rather than introducing an arbitrary GOST-specific timeout.

## GOST TLS security — mandatory Stage 2 server-trust closure

Complete fail-closed server verification:

- reject `verifyOk == 0`;
- reject any nonzero verification status;
- integrate Firefox temporary/permanent certificate overrides;
- positive browser-session verification cache keyed by exact server identity;
- prove valid Treasury hostname/chain succeeds;
- prove wrong hostname and invalid/untrusted chain fail;
- prove client private-key operations cannot occur before server trust.

Do not use a production verification bypass.

## GOST network coverage — later

After Stage 2 security/runtime closure:

- direct connection without proxy;
- HTTPS proxy / nested TLS;
- SOCKS lifecycle;
- proxy authentication/reconnect edge cases beyond the currently exercised HTTP CONNECT path.

## Final UX polish — later

After core GOST TLS is stable, evaluate transparent one-shot GOST discovery:

- explicit allowlist still enters MSSPI immediately;
- unknown host starts with NSS;
- only `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` may authorize one MSSPI retry;
- no retry loops;
- only a successful, normally verified GOST connection becomes session-confirmed;
- discovery cache is process/session scoped and never bypasses trust/client-auth policy.

## Windows Vista/7 compatibility — independent

Open work:

1. integrate proven `msvcr14x + modern Rust/libstd + narrow YY-Thunks` into full Firefox/xul while preserving `/MD`;
2. audit final PE set for direct API-set/VCRUNTIME/known Win8+ imports;
3. fix/replay delay-load parser and classify guarded post-Win7 paths;
4. run the resulting portable browser on real Windows 7 without the copied compatibility bundle;
5. expand real Win7 runtime coverage;
6. run GOST TLS on Win7 as a separate exact-build/runtime milestone.

## Bundled government-system extensions — independent

Current packaged three-extension artifact `9614275050` is packaging-proven and clean-profile discovery/enabled-state is proven for all three bundled project extensions.

Next:

1. re-check CryptoPro basic functionality on this exact package;
2. test legacy IFCPlugin with installed native host;
3. test Gosplugin with its local/native component;
4. verify the Russian-first content-language preference in runtime if desired;
5. generalize the historically CryptoPro-named packaging workflow to assert all three XPI + language pref;
6. transfer only proven shared packaging gates into the two main browser workflows;
7. later prove real version-to-version update behavior where a valid older/newer signed extension is available.

## Upstream base — deferred

Stay on r3dfox / Firefox 153. Do not migrate to Firefox 154 merely because upstream Mozilla has released it. Evaluate a newer base only after r3dfox itself publishes one and the user explicitly decides to upgrade.
